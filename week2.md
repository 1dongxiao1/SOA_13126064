Handing defect is an important part of the normal execution of various QA activities. And the most important activity associated with defect handling is defect resolution. In the case that a discovered defect is not corrected, all the parties involved must agree on the specific decisions or actions. To support defect resolution, defect logging and defect tracking are needed. In addition, to ensure proper collection and usage of defect data, we need to pay special attention to consistent defect interpretation and tracking as well as timely defect reporting.
	As a central part of QA activities, testing is an integral part of the waterfall development process, forming an important link in the overall development chain. Because of the possibilities of defect propagations and the increasing cost over time or successive development phases to fix defects once they are injected into the system, we need to reduce the number of faults in software systems by the combination of defect prevention and application of QA techniques that can help remove software faults early.
	The related QA activities to ensure that the right functions are performed are typically grouped as validation activities. They check whether a function needed and expected by the customers is present in a software product. Activities to ensure the correct or reliable performance of these specified functions are grouped as verification activities. 

Chapter5

There are three major groups of activities in the quality engineering process. And they are labeled in roughly chronological order as pre-QA activity, in-QA activity, and post-QA activity. 
	Pre-QA activities usually means quality planning including goal setting and strategy formation. When setting the goal, we should select or define the quality measurements and models commonly accepted by the customers and in the software engineering community fist. And then we need to find out the excepted values or ranges of the corresponding quality measurement. When it turns to formatting a strategy, there are also two important factors to be considered: the influence of quality perspectives and attributes and the influence of different quality level. Executing planned QA activities and handling discovered defects are among in-QA activities. And post-QA activities are consisted of quality measurement, assessment and improvement. 

Chapter6

Why testing? Testing fulfills two primary purpose: to demonstrate quality or proper activity and to detect and fix problems. The major test activities include the following in roughly chronological order: test planning and preparation, test execution and related activities, analysis and follow up. In the overall framework of software quality engineering, testing and inspection often finds different kinds of problems and should be viewed more as complementary QA alternatives instead of competing ones.
	What to test? The main difference between functional and structural testing is the perspective and the related focus: Functional testing focus on the external behavior of a software system or its various components, while structural testing focus on the internal implementation. Functional testing is also called black box testing, whose simplest form is to start running the software and make observations. And another common form of BBT is the use of specification checklists.
