We have not had such SQA course, but had a relevant one called Software Testing during our undergraduate course. In my opinion, software quality assurance consists of a means of monitoring the software engineering processes and methods used to ensure quality. It encompasses the entire software development process, which includes processes such as requirements definition, software design, coding, source code control, code reviews, change management, configuration management, testing, release management, and product integration. SQA is organized into goals, commitments, abilities, activities, measurements, and verifications. We can consider the quality of a software from such 3 terms, structure, function and performance, as well as developing and documents standards. To some extent, testing is a part of SQA.
